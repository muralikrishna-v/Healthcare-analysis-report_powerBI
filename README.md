## 🚀 Problem Statement
Many healthcare providers struggle to track and **analyze screening participation rates** across diverse demographics. Key challenges include:

-  **Lack of real-time insights** into screening participation.  
-  **Demographic disparities** affecting healthcare access.  
-  **Inefficient data-driven decision-making** due to unstructured data.  
-  **Limited visibility** into regional, racial, and linguistic differences.  

Without proper insights, **healthcare administrators cannot effectively allocate resources**, leading to **lower screening rates** and **inefficient interventions**.

## ✅ Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, this **interactive Power BI dashboard** was developed, providing:

1️⃣ **Key Screening Metrics** – Total eligible members, screening participation rates, and percentage of members who did not receive screening.  
2️⃣ **Demographic Segmentation** – Insights into screening participation by **ethnicity, region, language, and race**.  
3️⃣ **Filter Panel** – Users can filter the data dynamically by **metric, region, ethnicity, and race** to gain **customized insights**.  
4️⃣ **Data-Driven Decision Support** – Identify **underserved communities** and strategize **resource allocation accordingly**.
